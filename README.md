# 🚀 LeetCode & DSA Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode problems** and **DSA practice questions**.
Each solution is written in a clean and well-structured way, often with comments and explanations.

The goal of this repo:

* 📈 Track my problem-solving journey
* 🧠 Improve algorithmic thinking & coding skills
* 💼 Build a portfolio of coding practice for interviews

## 🛠 Languages Used

* Java 
* C++ 
* Python 
* Kotlin

## 🌟 How I Approach Problems

1. Understand the problem without looking at solutions.
2. Write a brute force approach first.
3. Optimize step by step.
4. Add comments explaining **why** not just **how**.

## 📌 Note

* I don’t post the original problem statements due to platform TOS.
* Only **my code and explanations** are included here.
